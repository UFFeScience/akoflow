# AkôFlow - Open Source Middleware for Containerized Scientific Workflows

AkôFlow is an open-source middleware for orchestrating and executing container-based scientific workflows across heterogeneous environments. It was originally developed within the e-Science Research Group at the Institute of Computing, Fluminense Federal University (UFF).

Although initially focused on Kubernetes-based workloads, AkôFlow has evolved to support general containerized execution across multiple infrastructures.

## Supported Environments

* Kubernetes (public cloud providers: AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
* Singularity (for local or HPC isolated execution)
* SDumont supercomputer (LNCC - Brazil)

⸻

## Maintainers
* [D.Sc. Daniel de Oliveira — Research Advisor](http://profs.ic.uff.br/~danielcmo/)
* [Wesley Ferreira - @ovvesley — Core Maintainer](https://github.com/ovvesley)
* Raphael Garcia — Maintainer

## Academic Context

AkôFlow originated as a final undergraduate project and has since expanded with broader contributions and integrations. It continues to serve both academic and industrial workflow execution scenarios.

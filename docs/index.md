# AkôFlow
AkôFlow is an open-source middleware for orchestrating and executing container-based scientific workflows across heterogeneous environments. It was originally developed within the e-Science Research Group at the Institute of Computing, Fluminense Federal University (UFF).

Although initially focused on Kubernetes-based workloads, AkôFlow has evolved to support general containerized execution across multiple infrastructures.
